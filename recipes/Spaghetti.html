        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 large cloves garlic, sliced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 ⅝ pounds spaghetti (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
         <li>Peel shrimp and place skin, heads, and tails into a large saucepan. Fill pan with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer, about 45 minutes.</li>
         <li>Combine tomatoes and 1/2 the parsley in a blender; puree until smooth.</li>
         <li>Heat olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and chile pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
         <li>Pour pureed tomato mixture into the pan with the peppers. Add water, tomato paste, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Stir well; add paprika. Let sauce simmer on low to medium heat until juices have reduced.</li>
         <li>Strain shrimp shells from the water. Bring water back to a boil and add spaghetti. Cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water and drain the rest.</li>
         <li>In the meantime, add shrimp to the tomato sauce. Add the reserved water, stir well, and cook until shrimp is pink, about 3 minutes. Plate spaghetti and spoon the sauce on top; garnish with the remaining parsley.</li>
    </ol>
