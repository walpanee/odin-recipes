    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Dough</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces Italian sausage</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh spinach leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>¾ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Spice Islands® Italian Herb Seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Spice Islands® Crushed Red Pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Spice Islands® Garlic Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other</h3>

    <li>2 cups pizza sauce, for dipping</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make dough: Combine 1 cup flour, yeast, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add very warm water and oil; mix until well blended, about 1 minute. Gradually add enough remaining flour to make a soft, slightly sticky dough ball. Knead on a floured surface, adding more flour if needed, until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes. Cover and let rest on the floured surface.</li>
        <li>While dough rests, make filling: Cook and stir sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crumbly and browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove sausage to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; discard grease from the skillet. Add spinach and water to the skillet; sauté over medium heat until spinach is wilted, 1 to 2 minutes; drain liquid. Return sausage to the skillet with spinach. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta, mozzarella, and egg in a mixing bowl. Stir in Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, and garlic salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll 1 dough piece into an 8-inch circle on a floured surface. Spread about 1/3 cup ricotta mixture over the bottom half of dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Top with heaping 1/3 cup sausage-spinach mixture. Fold the top half of dough over filling. Pull the edge of the lower crust over the top; fold and press layers together to seal. Transfer to a greased baking sheet; cut 3 to 4 vents on top. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer calzones to a wire rack to keep the bottom crust crisp while cooling slightly. Serve with pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
