    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>If you want to try mochi, this is a fun recipe to start with,” says recipe developer and test kitchen expert Juliana Hale. 
        We couldn’t agree more! This mochi muffin recipe is sweet, chewy, light, and fluffy. What’s not to love? </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Sweet rice flour: These mochi muffins start with glutinous or sweet rice flour (such as Mochiko).</li>
        <li>Sugars: A blend of brown and white sugars gives the perfect amount of sweetness. </li>
        <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the muffins rise. </li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make the muffins taste salty.</li>
        <li>Coconut milk: You’ll need a can of unsweetened coconut milk. </li>
        <li>Eggs: Two whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the muffin batter together. </li>
        <li>Butter: A half a stick of melted butter adds even more moisture and flavor. </li>
        <li>Vanilla: A dash of vanilla extract creates a deeper flavor. </li>
        <li>Maple syrup: Add more sweetness and warm flavor with two tablespoons of maple syrup. </li>
        <li>Sesame seeds: Sesame seeds take the flavor up a notch. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line twelve 2 1/2-inch muffin cups with paper bake cups or grease cups generously.</li>
        <li>Whisk together rice flour, sugars, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk together coconut milk, eggs, butter, vanilla, and maple syrup in a large bowl. Add flour mixture to coconut milk mixture and stir just until combined.</li>
        <li>Divide batter between prepared muffin cups, filling nearly full. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 minutes. Remove from pan and serve warm or cool completely. </li>
    </ol>
